1.	The first class that would benefit from a different Collection type is Credentials/CredentialsList, preferably LinkedHashSet.
	a.	While a user can have multiple accounts, each userâ€™s credentials need to be unique. By preventing duplicate credentials,
		it will ensure that users have unique login information, preventing multiple users having the same login credentials.
	
2.	The second class that would benefit would be the Order class, where the use of the standard HashSet type would be most beneficial.
	a.	This will ensure that orders in the list will not be duplicated, but order is not important as my program allows me to search through
		my elements for specific information, allowing me to find specifically what it is the user is looking for regardless of how it is sorted.
		While this will result in the test list of orders being in a random order, it will replicate real life as not all systems universally
		sort their data by default and sometimes the need to manually sort or search through files is required.
