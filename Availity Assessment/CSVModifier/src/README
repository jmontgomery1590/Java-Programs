Within this program, there will be two locations that placeholders are used. These are towards the beginning for file import,
using "FILEPATH" (on line 18) and towards the end, using "NEWFILEPATH" in the CSVWriter method (line 77). These are to be
replaced with the file path of whichever CSV file the user wants to use on their machine. I have provided a sample CSV file
that uses the appropriate format, located in the CSV Files folder within this project.
